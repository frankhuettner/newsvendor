## Patisserie *Cheers!*  (Part II)


Lucilla and Kay are contemplating to add a special, a very special "guest" to their menu. Kim Rough, the most famous chef in town with 2 Michelin stars, recently introduced his special line of exquisite chocolate featuring an incomparable taste of cumin. Kay has used this chocolate to create a very distinctive cup cake, which has both notes of the orient but also has a modern freshness to it.

This cake is certainly more expensive to produce. They have to buy Kim Rough's chocolate at a high price before assembling the cake.
This allows them to benefit from Kim's brand and popularity, which is only possible when using his original chocolate. The production cost of a cake therefore increases to € 4. Lucilla suggests that such a special cake could henceforth be sold for a little extra at € 5.5 and still give a decent margin. As this is a new product, both of them are not sure as to how many cakes of this special line could be sold each day. They guesstimate the demand somewhere from nothing to 60 cakes per day -- pretty much everything seems plausible. 

Can this be profitable by itself (i.e., for now we ignore the synergies with and cannibalism from other sales)?
