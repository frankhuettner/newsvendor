## Patisserie *Cheers!*  (Part III)

While Kay is still struggling with the many cakes unsold, Lucilla comes up with another argument. "All our customers also buy a coffee or tea. So not having cake loses the profit on drinks as well!" 

Indeed, the typical drink sells for € 4 dollars and the ingredients to make it cost about € 0.5. Adding this to the € 5 and € 1 dollar for a cake gives a combined unit profit and cost of € 9 and € 1.5, respectively. Moreover, as drinks are only made if ordered, their ingredients don't lose their value at the end of the day and the combined unit salvages for € 0.5.

Given all this, what would be the right amount of cakes to prepare in the morning?
