## Patisserie *Cheers!*  (Part IV)

Many customers order wedding or birthday cakes from Cheers!, which are carefully preplanned and delivered. This attracted additional customer requests from people who show up spontaneously at the weekend and ask whether it is possible to quickly make a nice birthday cake.

Kay has therefore thought about ways to get this done. Her idea is simple yet effective: a basic cake would serve as a foundation and a few optional customizations can be selected by the customer. The foundation can be prepared early in the morning. The personalization would be done within a few minutes upon order. Such cakes could be a nice additional offer, which does neither cannibalize from the very fancy preplanned cakes, nor from the mini cakes.

The question concerning the price was quickly answered: € 42. Production cost would amount to roughly € 10. Cheers! further took notice of requests in previous weeks, which led to the following prediction for daily demand on Saturday and Sunday:


|   | Chance (%) | Cakes Demanded |
|---|---|---|
| Best case | 20 | 2 |
| Most likely case | 50 | 1 |
| Worst case | 30 | 0 |

Lucilla and Kay quickly understood that the chance of selling at least one cake is 70%. Thus, having one cake ready for sale would yield an additional profit of 0.7 ×  € (42 -- 10) -- 0.3 × € 10 = € 19.4 in expectation for each weekend day.

Should they even prepare 2 cakes?
